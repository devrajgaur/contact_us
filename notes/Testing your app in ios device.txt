Testing your app on IOS
For iOS this is a little more complicated because you need an Apple ID or to sign up for a "Developer Account":

Open XCode, then open "Preferences>Accounts". Sign in with your ID.

"Manage Certificates" > click on the "+" sign and select "iOS Development".

Plug your device into your machine. Find your device in the drop down (Window > Organizer).

Below the Team pop-up menu, click Fix Issue.

In Xcode, click the Run button.

(in subsequent runs,
you can deploy to the iOS device with Android Studio,
VS Code,
or any other IDE of choice,
you just need to set up that certificate the first time with Xcode. Here's Apple's documentation on setting up Xcode to run a physical device.)
